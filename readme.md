## Description

_The short description pretty much got it. As for the current version, the game is not quite playable._

#### Command Reference
 To go somewhere, type one of the directions. Directions are as follows; **right**, **left**, **ventral**, **dorsal**, **cranial** and **caudal**.

When items are implimented, you can use **Take** and the name of the item to take it.

**Look** displays the room description and exits and items in it. Alternatively, if you specify an item, it will display that instead. Again, items haven't been implimented yet.
